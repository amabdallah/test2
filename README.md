Its very important to write and organize the script files so I can understand them and others too. This product will be open source. 


##Let me know:   

1. Are you comfortable in doing such work.   

2. What is the most challenging thing do you see   

3. How much time you expect it will take? (be Realistic) and if you will be dedicated to complete it as soon as you can  

4. How much do you want in return?    
 
5. Are you ready to work and turn in Milestone#1 below?    

# Tentative Milestones     
## Milestone#1      
A functional GUI in Python that connects with SQLite. A Model-View-Controller design architecture. Separate the wxFormBuilder forms from the rest of the code. Functional GUI means that I want an interactive front-end. Every Ribbon tab click should pop up its corresponding wizard or dialog box as designed in wxFormBuilder and explained in the specification.

## Milestone#2   
Implement software business rules to verify reading input data from spreadsheets. View spreadsheet input data within the Wizard. 

## Milestone#3  
Load spreadsheet input into the tables that are independent (like the CVs tables) or have one dependency on other tables. Perform software business rules and constraints.

## Milestone#4   
Implement the logic to import networks  

## Milestone#5   
Implement the logic to import data values 

## Milestone#6   
Revise software bunisness rules and verify the loaded data with SQL queires 

## Milestone#7
Debug errors or implements updates and feedback

## Milestone#8
Debug errors or implements updates and feedback

## Milestone#9
Debug errors or implements updates and feedback

## Milestone#10
Finalize and deliver the Wizard
