Its very important to write and organize the script files so I can understand them and others too. This product will be open source. 


##Let me know:   

1. Are you comfortable in doing such work.   

2. What is the most challenging thing do you see   

3. How much time you expect it will take? (be Realistic) and if you will be dedicated to complete it as soon as you can  

4. How much do you want in return?    
 
5. Are you ready to work and turn in Milestone#1 below?    

## Milstone#1     
A functional GUI in Python that connects with SQLite. A Model-View-Controller design architecture. Separate the wxFormBuilder forms from the rest of the code. Functional GUI means that I want an interactive front-end. Every Ribbon tab click should pop up its corresponding wizard or dialog box as designed in wxFormBuilder and explained in the specification.
