Improve two existing working SQLite queries by adding a pivot on a few rows to become columns.  
See the excel sheet (Query_As_is_desired_Results) where I show As-is results and the desired results (how the new query result should look like)

1. Execute this query MultiColumns.sql on the MultiColumns.sqlite database 
2. Execute this query SeasonalParameter.sql on the Seasonal.sqlite database
